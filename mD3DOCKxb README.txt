Building AutoDock from source tar File
======================================

Download the "src" tar file from the web site.
Unzip the downloaded tar file into a directory of your choice.

For ARCHOSV below, substitute your
computer type and operating system version, such as "i86Linux2".
You can use any name you like; nothing in the build process depends
on the name. We suggest:
  i86Linux2 : 32-bit Intel Linux
  x86_64Linux2 : 64-bit Intel Linux
  universalDarwin9 : Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 Intel or PPC
  universalDarwin11 : Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.8 Intel
  i86Windows : Microsoft Windows Intel
  sun4SunOS5 : SPARC Solaris

Build mD3DOCKxb.
